## Basic
machine level programming, which are a sequence of bytes are very hard for human to understand. So we will study Assembly code, which is also a low level instructions.

### history of Intel Processors
- Intel x86 Processors
	- Complex Instruction set computer (CISC)
	- Evolutionary design (introduced in 1978, 8086)

8086 (First 16 bit) -> 386 (First 32 bit) -> Pentium 4E (First 64-bit) -> Core 2 (First multi core )-> Core i7

### Architecture (also ISA : Instruction set Architecture)
The parts of a processor design that one needs to understand or write assembly/machine code.
e.g. Instruction set specification, registers.
Example ISA: x86, ARM

### Microarchitecture
Implementation of the architecture. eg. cache size and core frequency.

### Code Forms:
- Machine code : The byte-level programs that a processor executes
- Assembly code : A text representation of machine code.


## Mechanisms in Proceduers
