## Vectors
- (pg. 32 ) We can think of vector as identifying points in space, with each element giving the coordinate along a different axis.

### Matrices
- (pg. 33) The transport of a matrix is the mirror image of the matrix across a diagonal line, called the **main diagonal**. The transport is defined such as
$$ (A^T)_{i, j} =  A_{j, i} $$
