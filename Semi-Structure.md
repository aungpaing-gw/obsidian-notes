Stored in non-relational database system, sometimes called NoSQL databases.

NoSQL, does not means the data stored cannot be queried using SQL. A better way to think of it is not only SQL.

Non-relational databases are built to store semi-structure and unstructure data in a way that provides for rapid collection and retrieval.
The data is mostly stored in two formats
- Document Stores
	- JSON, BSON, XML. Navigat using Python and NodeJS.
- Key-Value Stores
	- DyanmoDB
	- Logically, the data is stored in a single table. Within table, the values are associated with a specific key.
	- The values are stored in the form of a blob objects and do not required a predefined schema.
